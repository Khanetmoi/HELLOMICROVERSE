# Hello Microverse project

# Description the project.
In this project, I will set up a "Hello world" repository. No complex coding is required for this exercise. My goal here is to master all of the tools and best practices I learned about in previous steps. I will be using them in all Microverse projects and most likely in my future job as well, so it is important to know them!

## Built With
   -  HTML5
   -  CSS3
